This post summarizes material I presented at the [PAPIs](https://papis.io) (Predictive APIs) Global conference in Boston in October 2018. The goal of the talk was to cover aspects of machine learning interpretability and explainability that are most relevant to the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
