## March Madness Tournament Predictions

An attempt to forecast the champion of the 2018 NCAA basketball tournament using machine learning. This entry was originally published on the [BigML blog](https://blog.bigml.com/2018/03/22/finding-sense-in-march-madness-with-machine-learning/). 

If you are one of the approximately 54 million Americans that filled out a bracket to predict the NCAA Menâ€™s Basketball tournament this year, odds are that your bracket was no longer perfect within the first 24 hours of tournament, and substantially off track by the end of the opening weekend. Correctly predicting all 63 games (ignoring the 4 play-in games) is infamously difficult, with a probability that ranges from 1 in 9.2 quintillion to a much more manageable 1 in 128 billion, depending on who is counting. With such low odds, it is no surprise that Warren Buffet had famously offered a $1 billion prize to anyone who correctly picks every winner.
